# Silva SSU 138, version 2

This R-markdown document provides an update to the Silva 138 database generated by the document in [silva-138-v1](../silva-138-v1).
It downloads the Silva 138 SSU (16S) taxonomy database from the Silva website and formats it for [use with DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html) using a new method
(implemented in DADA2) that does not rely on mothur-preprocessed files.
This version includes an addition training file designed specifically for full-length 16S amplicon sequencing.
The resulting dada2-formatted database files and further information are available at (https://zenodo.org/record/3986799).
