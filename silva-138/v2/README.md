# Silva SSU 138, version 2

This R-markdown document provides an update to the Silva 138 database generated by the document in [silva-138/v1](../v1).
It downloads the Silva 138 SSU (16S) taxonomy database from the Silva website and formats it for [use with DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html) using a new method
(implemented in DADA2) that does not rely on mothur-preprocessed files.
This version includes an addition training file designed specifically for full-length 16S amplicon sequencing.
The resulting dada2-formatted database files and further information are available at (https://zenodo.org/record/3986799).

In March 2021 I was [alerted by a user](https://github.com/mikemc/dada2-reference-databases/issues/1) to a problem with a small fraction of taxa;
see (https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2/issues/1293) and the "bad-taxa" R-markdown and html files in this folder for more information.
A list of affected taxa are in [bad-taxa.csv](./bad-taxa.csv).
